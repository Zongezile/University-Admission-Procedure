# University-Admission-Procedure

I was implement an algorithm to determine which applicants are going to be enrolled.

At the beginning of the program, we provide the number of people who can get to the course as much as possible.
The program downloads candidates from a .txt file, their results from 4 matura exams and one entrance examination per faculty (it is taken into account only if its result is higher than the average of the examinations taken into account for a given direction of study) and their first, second and third choice the direction they want to go.
The algorithm selects N candidates for each department and saves them in separate .txt files.
